Based on https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-analog-clock-using-html-css-and-javascript/

0. Upload all the files to your site.
1. Edit or change the "bgImage-300x300.jpg" file to define your own clock face.
2. See index.html to analize the markup you need to implement to make this work on your website.
3. Edit worldClock.js to define any timezone you wosh to add. You need only edit the line "hr = d.getUTCHours() + 9;" where you add or subtract the time difference from UTC to the location you would like to add.
